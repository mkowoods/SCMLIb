README for SCMLib

This Project is an attempt to create a Library to help with estimating SCM Forecasting Problems and Inventory Management issues.

This class is inspired by my current work as well as a course through MITx CTL.SC1x(relevant pdf's from the course will be saved as well)

3. create Classes around different forecasting techniques that takes in a time-series data and performas certain fits

4. implment exponential smoothing, holt and holt-winter models.

5. have a testing and training Class determine the best choic of the various Algorithms
